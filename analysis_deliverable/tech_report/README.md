# Tech Report
This is where you can type out your tech report.

### A defined hypothesis or prediction task, with clearly stated metrics for success.


### Why did you use this statistical test or ML algorithm? 

### Which other tests did you consider or evaluate? 


### How did you measure success or failure? Why that metric/value? What challenges did you face evaluating the model? Did you have to clean or restructure your data?


### What is your interpretation of the results? Do accept or deny the hypothesis, or are you satisfied with your prediction accuracy? For prediction projects, we expect you to argue why you got the accuracy/success metric you have. Intuitively, how do you react to the results? Are you confident in the results?


### For your visualization, why did you pick this graph? What alternative ways might you communicate the result? Were there any challenges visualizing the results, if so, what where they? Will your visualization require text to provide context or is it standalone (either is fine, but it's recognize which type your visualization is)?


### Full results + graphs (at least 1 stats/ml test and at least 1 visualization). You should push your visualizations to the /analysis_deliverable/visualizations folder in your repo. Depending on your model/test/project we would ideally like you to show us your full process so we can evaluate how you conducted the test!

### If you did a statistics test, are there any confounding trends or variables you might be observing?


### If you did a machine learning model, why did you choose this machine learning technique? Does your data have any sensitive/protected attributes that could affect your machine learning model?
