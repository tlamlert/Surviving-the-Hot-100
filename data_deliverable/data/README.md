# Data Spec
This is where you will be describing your data spec comprehensively. Please refer to the handout for a couple of examples of good data specs.

You will also need to provide a sample of your data in this directory. Please delete the example `sample.db` and replace it with your own data sample. ***Your sample does not necessarily have to be in the `.db` format; feel free to use `.json`, `.csv`, or any other data format that you are most comfortable with***.
